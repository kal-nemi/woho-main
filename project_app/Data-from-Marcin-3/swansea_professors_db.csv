These collaborations have primarily concentrated on the mechanical performance and structural integrity of additive manufactured (AM) materials, and implementing the relevant methodologies capable of replicating true in-service conditions.</p>"",""<p>Professor Lancaster is a pioneer in the use of SPT methodologies and their application to additive structures and has developed a unique SP fatigue testing capability unrivalled across the world. He has been officially recognised as the UK national expert for SPT, is a board member of the BSi ISE 101/01 Uniaxial Testing Committee, Secretary of the IOM<sup>3</sup> Structure &amp; Properties of Materials Committee and IOM<sup>3</sup> Particulate Engineering Committee. He has published over 60 journal and conference articles, an invited book chapter on SP creep and guest edited two special editions of the journal Materials, focussed on SPT and the mechanical properties of additive structures. This led to Professor Lancaster chairing the 5th International Small Sample Test Techniques conference (SSTT2018) convened in Swansea, Wales in July 2018. This biennial series of conferences provides the dominant platform for disseminating research on small scale testing technologies with SSTT2018 attracting over 80 delegates from 15 countries with over 50 papers published in the conference proceedings, for which Professor Lancaster acted as the Principal Editor. Furthermore, he guest edited a special issue of the journal Theoretical &amp; Applied Fracture Mechanics that captured some of the recent breakthroughs that were presented at the conference.</p>""]",Null,5785772249,Robert,Lancaster,[],Professor
