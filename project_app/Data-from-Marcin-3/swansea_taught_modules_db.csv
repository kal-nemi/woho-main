This module tests a variety of fundamental engineering skills, highlights the importance of basic project management skills and serves to provide experience of working in partnership with others. Projects are student-led with support and feedback available from the staff during project classes. The module considers the formulation of both material and energy balances for operations which involve either recycle or by-pass systems, and is aligned with key concepts introduced in EG100 (Chemical Process Principles). The module also considers vapour-liquid equilibria with application to the basic design of unit operations. These concepts are then used to assist the design a manufacturing process and students are encouraged to further assess the safety impact of their chosen design. The team design project leads to the production of a design report which is the major assessed component within the module.
