As such, we would like to understand the technology available in the market for Voice of the Customer analytics software solutions.  The high level outcomes DWP would like to see as a result of improved insights are:-	Improved Customer Experience Levels-	Proactive and pre-emptive service delivery-	Root-cause detection to drive improved outcomes-	Rapid Response for customers with complex needs or vulnerabilities-	Empowered agents and teams with greater understanding of their personal impact -	De-centralised insights in a feedback loop directly back into agents / team leaders-	Richer granularity of insights to inform actionable tasks -	Significant cost-savings from earlier interventions (reduction in repeat calls/unnecessary agent/customer effort).DWP would expect the technology to work in synergy with our operating model and customer experience strategy to support:-	Automatic identification of calls where customers indicate they tried and failed to complete a task on their own and route this information directly to a suitable agent-	Analytics on call disposition (triangulated with other operational M.I) to understand why customers repeatedly call us and pinpoint which issues are unable to be resolved on the first call and how can agents be coached to handle these queries more effectively. -	Our understanding of customer and agent behavior on calls that are too long or too short to resolve issues. On calls that results in transfers or escalations. -	Round the clock analytics in the form of ""listening-posts"" on our different channels (on-line, telephony and even mail) that can identify, prioritise, and alert agents of macro level issues. Dynamic identification would result in quicker resolution, proactive action, deflection of call volume, and cost savings.Solutions should also be easy to integrate with our systems and conform to our security and data protection requirements.

Designing and creating content for these platforms, including advertisements, is time-consuming and requires expertise which the team currently do not have. Professional creative input is therefore needed to ensure maximum engagement with this demographic.

Stream 1 will be for market entry projects. Stream 2 will be for more mature projects that can proceed quickly and play into HMG's ambitious agenda to scale-up hydrogen use as well as potentially providing a pipeline of projects for the £240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund.1.	https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hydrogen-supply-competitionStream 1 is expected to run over two phases as outlined below:Stream 1: Phase 1 - Feasibility (up to £6m, TRL 4-6) -TRN: 5044/04/2021It is proposed that Stream 1: Phase 1 will support development of feasibility studies, valued at up to £300k per project. This phase will support development of the project team's understanding of the core and ancillary technology, the performance of the technology, the market potential, the route to market (including competition) and costs and delivery plan for Phase 2. Funding will be split between four categories.•	Category 1 - Low carbon hydrogen production - this Category will support projects that will have some residual direct emissions even when coupled with Carbon Capture Utilisation and Storage (CCUS). •	Category 2 - Zero carbon hydrogen production - this Category will support projects that do not directly produce emissions.•	Category 3 - Hydrogen storage and transport - this Category will support the development of novel hydrogen storage and transport/distribution solutions (including import/export).•	Category 4 - Net zero hydrogen supply solutions - this Category will support solutions aiming to decarbonise the wider energy system.Stream 1: Phase 2 - Demonstration (up to £24m)It is envisaged that Stream 1: Phase 2 will down-select projects following Phase 1 and support demonstrations with up to £6m per project. This phase will support the physical demonstration of the technology, including build, trial, decommissioning and knowledge dissemination. Companies will also develop technical and business plans for market deployment.Stream 2 is expected to be run over a single phase as outlined below:Stream 2: Demonstration (up to £30m, TRL 6/7) - TRN: 5045/04/2021It is proposed that Stream 2 supports projects across all four of the Stream 1 categories that are closer to market. This could support demonstration of projects with up to £10m per project available to demonstrate the hydrogen supply opportunities. This includes build, trial, decommissioning and knowledge dissemination.  Incubation support will be available for successful small and medium sized enterprise (SME) awardees who are the lead partner in receipt of funding.",Low Carbon Hydrogen Supply 2 SBRI Competition - Expression of Interest

It affects the kidneys, heart and brain. If a patient is treated outside a specialist centre, mortality is 50%; in a specialist centre, it is 20%. There is also an appreciable acute morbidity, particularly in neurological disorders.The Condition can be difficult to diagnose because initial presentation can be non-specific and this is a very rare disease. Rapid treatment is essential for optimal outcomes and includes plasma exchange and a range of drugs. This disease primarily affects Adults. Children are treated in paediatric haematology centres and are outside the scope of this process.In response to a recommendation from the Prescribed Specialised Services Advisory Group in 2014, NHS England developed a service model that aimed to balance the high levels of multi-disciplinary expertise required to treat patients with TTP with the requirement for patients to be treated rapidly to have optimal outcomes. NHS England undertook a public consultation on the draft service specification, which closed in October 2018. The consultation documents are still available on the NHS England website at this link:Consultation on service specifications for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) for all ages - NHS England - Citizen Space.The model of delivery is to offer in-patient care within a specialist TTP centre, Patients with TTP require lifelong monitoring and follow up to manage relapse. Shared care is possible, based on the preference of the patient. Specialist TTP centres are required to undertake a clinical leadership, proactive education and outreach service to hospitals within their region to improve the identification of patients with TTP and the timely referral of patients to the specialist TTP centres. Specialist TTP centres are required to establish robust clinical partnerships with paediatric haematology centres to provide support in relation to the treatment of children and to agree a transition policy.To register your interest in these services please follow this link https://uk.eu-supply.com/ctm/supplier/publictenders?B=UK and either login or register on EU Supply and search from ID number 43998.

The framework is due to be awarded on 29th October 2021 and will run for a period of four years from its commencement which is anticipated to be in November 2021. The established framework will consist of six suppliers split over two tiers. Tier 1 will consist of 3-4 suppliers. Tier 2 will consist of 2-3 suppliers and will act as a contingency resource. All suppliers must have the ability to provide comprehensive multi-disciplinary services within the role of lead consultant.             The framework will be available to all current and future SCG and SCOPAC members who are classified as Contacting Authorities. In addition, the framework will also be accessible to all contracting authorities situated within England.  The value of the framework is estimated to be in the region of £5M over 4 years based upon the forecast requirements of SCG and SCOPAC members. In the event of further schemes or take up by other Contracting Authorities across England, the total value of the framework could increase to up to £50M, however a figure £15M is more likely.            The average value of commissions called off via the framework by SCG and SCOPAC is likely to range from £150K to £500K. However, there is also likely to be frequent commissions below £50K and on occasion in excess of £1million. Once established, contracting authorities will have a variety of call-off mechanisms and contracting options available for use which include for both mini-competition and direct award options. Call-off contracts will be let using either the NEC4 PSC or TSC in either the long or short form and with the choice of all options as proportionate and relevant to the services which are being commissioned.            The framework will be established using the Restricted Procedure as set out within the Public Contracts Regulations (2015). The council anticipates shortlisting a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 8 suppliers from assessment of returned Supplier Selection Questionnaire submissions who will then be invited to tender.

The project will act as a platform for a nation-wide creative response to the solutions and messages in the film. Just Imagine provides a platform for artists throughout the UK to create a new narrative on the protection of nature in a way that brings people together and educates and inspires their communities to protect our planet by entering our creative competition.The competition was open to the whole creative arts sector and judged by a panel, with the 12 winners securing space in our exhibition, which launched virtually on 29th April. Winners in each disciplinary category will form a group who will work with WWF and stage further public exhibitions of their work. WWF will work with the winners and entrants to establish further activations for the artwork. Once safe to do so, we will run a touring exhibition which will be taken to communities, decision-makers and showcased in open air locations throughout the UK. The exhibition aims to influence and mobilise the communities in which it takes place to illustrate the power of the creative community in shaping new ways of thinking.One of the core purposes of this work is to connect with audiences that WWF-UK have so far had limited engagement with and to provide opportunities for people and communities that are often underrepresented in the environment movement/climate action.WWF-UK requires a suitably experienced individual or consulting firm to deliver some specific management and development tasks concerning Just Imagine.

A growth in new supply of qualified doctors requires significant investment in the expansion of medical places. Accelerated routes providing shortened training programmes requires amendment of the Medical Act 1983; and prior to 2021 were also bound by the EU Directive requirement of 5,500 hours of training.  With regards to diversity, the NHS Interim People Plan (IPP) quotes ""There is much more that can be done, both to recruit people from the widest possible range of backgrounds, and to offer them satisfying and developing careers in the NHS over their working lives"".  With regards to training routes, the IPP states ""Apprenticeships will continue to be critical in attracting people to the NHS from less well represented groups and supporting the development of new roles.""Therefore, HEE is exploring how to grow the supply of different entry routes into medicine to widen access to the career in view of the high demand.  One route being created is that of Medical Apprenticeships.  To deliver medical training via an apprenticeship model, HEE is commissioning a Provider to create an innovative, accessible blended-learning medical degree that meets the standards outlined in Outcome for Graduates set by the General Medical Council (GMC).This blended-learning medical degree will be available across England for prospective medical apprenticeship students. The programme aims to fully exploit innovation in digital and other technologies to provide a fully blended, interactive, and innovative programme that will meet the requirements set by the GMC for medical graduates. This is an exciting opportunity to support the creation of a significantly different offer in medical education that will support the growth of an expert and professional workforce suited to the demands of 21st Century care and service. Successful bidders must therefore demonstrate an ability to work in partnership with diverse practice and other partners to attract and recruit individuals who meet or exceed the agreed entry levels for the provision being offered.We are particularly interested in attracting prospective medical apprenticeship students from diverse backgrounds including students from low participation areas, mature students, students from remote, rural and coastal areas, Ethnic Minority backgrounds etc.To express interest and access the Tender Documentation please use the link below, Please note all communications must be raised via the portal.https://health-family.force.com/s/Welcome",Blended Learning Medical Degree for Medical Apprenticeships

There is an option to extend on-going support and maintenance element of the contract for further 12 months at the sole discretion of the Authority.Background Our Healthier South East London (OHSEL) is a partnership of health and care organisations responsible for looking after the health and care of the 1.9 million people living in Bexley, Bromley, Greenwich, Lambeth, Lewisham and Southwark. The partnership is made up of NHS South East London Clinical Commissioning Group, NHS Trust providers, Local Authorities, other health and care providers, alongside voluntary and third sector organisations. In 2019 OHSEL became London's first integrated care system. South East London Integrated Care System (ICS) brings together local health and care organisations and local councils to re-design care and improve population health, through shared leadership and collective action. The aim of South East London ICS is to build on the collaboration of the partners to date through Our Healthier South East London by addressing three problems in local healthcare:•	The health and wellbeing gap - people should be helped to lead healthier and longer lives•	The care and quality gap - variation in the accessibility and quality of care should be improved•	The funding and efficiency gap - the NHS must become more efficient and make better use of the money availableIt has recently been announced that integrated care systems will become statutory bodies in 2022 if legislation is passed later this year (exact timings still TBC). Current proposals envisage an ICS to be made up of an ICS Health and Care Partnership, bringing together the NHS, local government and partners, and an ICS NHS Body. The latter will be responsible for the day to day running of the ICS, while the ICS Health and Care Partnership will focus on bringing together systems to support integration and develop a plan to address the systems' health, public health, and social care needs.The South East London ICS is our vehicle for delivering system transformation and achieving our goals of reducing health inequalities and achieving system sustainability.

The central section of the pier consists of a T-shape extension to the original pier added in the 1950's. This provided a front edge of approximately 49m and allowed for berthing in deeper water. This was then extended in the early 2000's to provide NLB with a larger operational surface area, extending the central section by approximately 10m and creating new eastern and western sections to the pier. All seaward faces have timber fender piles, though only the central section is currently used for berthing.            Based upon visual assessment of the timber elements, it was concluded that a number of repairs are required to bring the structure up to a satisfactory standard. The condition of the timbers is generally poorest at the lowest sections. Repairs have been recommended for the most critical elements, in terms of the importance of their function and the severity of the defects. These are detailed in Appendix A - Bill of Quantities and Appendix B - Inspection Report. This tender will cover items detailed in the report under Option A.            Works to replace rotten timbers are summarised as follows:            •Replace 9 No. full pile with like-for-like 360x360mm greenheart pile, replacing brackets, bolts, nuts and spacers as required.      •Replace 4 No. fender with heavy-duty rubber D-fender, replacing fixings as required.      •Replace stair support waling with like-for-like 360x360mm greenheart waling beam, replacing brackets, nuts and bolts as required.       •Replace total 41m of lower waling with like-for-like 360x360mm greenheart waling beam, replacing splice plates, brackets, nuts and bolts as required.      •Replace total 36m of lower intercostals with like-for-like 260x260mm greenheart members (in approx. 2.55m lengths), replacing fixings as required.      •Replace 24m of cope beam with like-for-like greenheart members (210x210mm and 260x150mm), replacing fixings as required.      •Reinstate 16 No. failed connection, replacing nuts, bolts and spacers as required (excluding those associated with repairs listed above).

It has been tasked by the Department of Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) to deliver the Green Homes Grants (GHG) Local Authority Delivery (LAD) Phase 2.GHG was announced in the Chancellor's Summer Economic Update in July 2020 as part of a green recovery. This £2bn programme will include £1.5bn of retrofit grants, available as vouchers directly to homeowners and landlords; and £0.5bn for fuel poor households, delivered as GHG LAD, through BEIS and the five Energy Hubs across the country. BEIS allocated a Phase 1 grant pot of £200m for immediate delivery in 2020/21, which local authorities bid for directly to BEIS; followed by Phase 2 of £300m which will be delivered through the Energy Hubs.GHG LAD will help low income households improve the energy efficiency of their homes and reduce their energy bills. A low income is defined as those with a combined household income of no more than £30,000. Eligible homes will be those with Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) rated E, F or G and D (up to 50% of the SW Energy Hub area). Households in any tenure will be eligible. It is anticipated that the energy efficiency and clean heating measures installed will cost no more than £10,000 per property on average (for owner occupiers). Social and private landlords will be expected to match fund at least 33%, with grant limited to a £5k average.The strategic objectives for GHG LAD are:• Achieving net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2050• Delivering a green recovery from COVID-19• Meeting the Fuel Poverty Target for England to raise poor quality homes to EPC B and C• Decarbonising heatUpdate:We have concluded a recent procurement exercise which did not result in complete contract coverage so we are now re-engaging with the market to help refine our options.We are particularly interested to engage with:• Delivery agents/scheme administrators• Householder engagement organisations• Retrofit co-ordinators• Retrofit assessors/auditorsShould you wish to participate in this exercise please click the following link to view the presentation and questionnaire:https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=00cf978a-5ab9-eb11-810c-005056b64545&p=696a9836-1895-e511-8105-000c29c9ba21Failure to engage with this process will not preclude or disadvantage any bidder in any possible future procurement process.",Green Homes Grants - Local Authority Delivery (Phase 2) - Market Engagement and update

UK Sport is looking to carry out a study to track public attitudes towards Olympic and Paralympic sport via a series of mostly quarterly online surveys starting in late June 2021.  We have been carrying out similar survey work since August 2017 and so already have a framework questionnaire for this purpose.  We will wish to continue many lines of enquiry into the new study but are likely to want to introduce some additional areas into the research that align with aspects of our new strategy https://www.uksport.gov.uk/about-us/strategic-plan.  With UK Sport planning for three surveys in and around the period of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games (see below), bidders should prepare a proposal comprising a total of ten general adult surveys, plus two separate surveys of children and young people.   2.	For the purposes of preparing their proposals, bidders can work on the basis that the adult questionnaire will comprise up to 20 closed questions and up to three open questions.  In terms of the sample, we are anticipating a UK-representative sample of c2000 adults aged 16+, including a Northern Ireland element.  As far as the two children and young people strands are concerned, we have hitherto achieved samples of 500 and have an existing questionnaire comprising 15 closed questions and open questions.  We are keen to hear from bidders about their proposals for recruiting young participants and maximising the effectiveness of the survey process with young people. 3.	As mentioned above, we wish to carry out three surveys in and around Tokyo.  (see attached for further info) Tasks required 4.	Working closely with the UK Sport project team, the successful contractor will be required: i.	to undertake the administration of the required surveys including design and administration/distribution of the questionnaires;  ii.	to carry out all data processing and analysis consistent with the research objectives. This must include standard data tables (including coded verbatim comments) for each wave of the tracker survey and the three additional surveys, plus a full validated SPSS data set for each waveiii.	to produce (within two weeks of fieldwork closing) a brief report in Powerpoint form of each wave of the tracker survey, comparing the results of the new wave with those from the previous wave or waves.  The exception to this will be in relation to the three 'Tokyo' waves of the tracker as no report will be required for either the pre-Games wave or the inter-Games wave.  However, upon the conclusion of the post-Games wave, the successful bidder will be required to produce a full report, reflecting on the findings arising from the three waves as a whole.Please see ITT for detailed instructions about the Specification and how to apply.",PROVISION OF RESEARCH SERVICES (Public Attitudes Tracker)

The school has been extended over the years and one unfortunate consequence of this is that a lower-level roof between teaching rooms and ancillary spaces is now within a well (below the main roof) where water can be trapped.

Most people who sleep rough do so in the City and this is where most of the supported accommodation and support services are concentrated. Although the City of Oxford has the highest levels of homelessness, we know that tackling homelessness needs to be a collective and county wide effort, with many of the housing solutions lying outside the City. A strong and emerging partnership of statutory and voluntary community sector partners have been working over the long term to prevent and resolve homelessness. There is also a high level of commitment to ending homelessness and to finding better solutions which are centred around people's needs and aspirations. Strategic context: The vision and priorities for ending homelessness are set out in the County Wide Strategy as follows: Vision: To prevent and resolve homelessness, so that no one sleeps rough in Oxfordshire.Principles:	We treat people in need of our services with respect	We acknowledge people as individuals and work with their strengths  	We work in a 'psychologically informed way', understanding how past trauma and adverse childhood experiences affect people who experience homelessness	We actively involve people affected by homelessness in identifying solutions and offer choice wherever possible 	We focus on the health, wellbeing and quality of life of people who experience homeless, addressing the whole person, not just housing needs 	We co-operate to deliver a co-ordinated and consistent service across the county Priorities:	Proactively prevent homelessness	Rapid response to rough sleeping	Focus on the person, not the problem	Timely move on	The right home in the right placeWe are commissioning for outcomes and inviting Alliances, made up of a minimum of four providers, to tell us how they will organise themselves to collectively deliver on these outcomes. Separate but identical contracts will be held with each member of the alliance. As statutory organisations, we will work with the successful Alliance to design a system that will enable the vision - To prevent and resolve homelessness, so that no one sleeps rough in Oxfordshire - to become a reality.

The intention was that as many service users as possible will take up these digital offers. However, the HMCTS customer base is a varied one, and there is a need to support a potentially significant number of digitally excluded users who cannot or choose not to go online by themselves. This principle underpins the HMCTS vision of a justice system that is accessible to all. HMCTS also recognises that the customer base faces a wide range of digital exclusion barriers that they may require assistance and support to overcome.We define 'access' as the ability for any person to find and use the necessary resources to interact and journey through court and tribunal services, without having to overcome any unreasonable barriers to doing so. There are many barriers that may hinder members of the public from accessing our future services. This may include, for example, financial constraints, lack of internet access, low confidence in using digital services, poor literacy or disability. The key role of this service is to provide users of HMCTS services who may face barriers to accessing digital platforms with the bespoke support required to successfully access justice services digitally.

This funding draws on ECC's Adult Education Budget funding allocation from the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA). There is a maximum of £150,000 available. The maximum funding that organisations may bid for is £50,000. Projects must deliver a minimum of 250 enrolments.ECC is looking to award funding to organisations that can demonstrate the most effective way in which the money will be used and has the greatest impact on learners.Projects supported by this funding are intended to help address the issue of worklessness in Essex. The aim of the fund is to develop the skills levels of residents (aged 19 and over) whilst complementing other available provision and providing progression routes to further learning, employment and volunteering. To reach individuals and local communities across Essex, we would particularly welcome bids from voluntary, community and social enterprise organisations whose reach extends to those in greatest need.The key objectives of this funding are: •	To deliver a programme of community learning activities which enable adults to move towards sustained employment and active citizenship, involving one or more of the following:	improve employability and essential skills, including digital skills 	provide opportunities for learners to become involved in the local community	increase learners' confidence and motivation 	have a positive effect on learners' health and wellbeing•	To encourage Essex residents who are not in employment and have low level skills to engage in learning and progress to further training opportunities, particularly targeting those who mainstream provision struggles to engage or help to progress into further learning or employment. •	To provide Information, Advice and Guidance for residents not in employment about further learning, volunteering or mainstream employment services and/or getting work.The priority target group for activities supported by this fund is unemployed adults (aged 19 or over and resident in Essex), particularly those who have completed a 'work programme' without progressing into employment, those with low level skills and those who are less likely to be engaged into learning directly by a mainstream provider. These are likely to include: •	Universal Credit claimants who are out of work•	Job Seekers Allowance claimants•	Income Support claimants•	Employment Support Allowance claimants•	Disability Living Allowance or Personal Independence Payment claimants•	Other working age people not on benefits who wish to return to the labour market.",ACL Essex Learning Partnership Fund 2021-2022

This contract is for 4 weeks over the summer holiday period with a view to being extended for the Christmas provision through a variation of contract option. A full evaluation of the summer provision will determine the delivery of the Christmas provision.The Holiday Activities and Food (HAF) Programme is funded by the Department for Education (DfE) and provides funding up to the end of 2021-22, this supports the government's commitment to establish a Flexible Childcare fund to increase the availability of high quality and affordable flexible childcare.The free holiday club places must be targeted at children who are eligible for and receiving benefits-related free school meals (FSM). However, up to 15% of the programme funding can be used to provide free or subsidised holiday club places for children who are not in receipt of benefits-related free school meals but who are considered by the local authority as vulnerable or in need of this provision. For example, this may include children assessed as being in need, looked-after children, children with an EHC plan (education, health and care), children assessed as otherwise vulnerable, or children living in areas of high deprivation.This specification outlines the local context including the council's commitment to support children and their families, the need for promotion and advertising, mobilisation requirements and the Framework required for delivery as set out by the DfE.School holidays can be particular pressure points for some families because of increased costs (such as food and childcare) and reduced incomes. For some children that can lead to a holiday experience gap - with children from disadvantaged families are less likely to access organised out-of-school activities; more likely to experience 'unhealthy holidays' in terms of nutrition and physical health and are more likely to experience social isolationFree holiday clubs are a response to this issue and evidence suggests that they can have a positive impact on children and young people. It also shows that they work best when they provide consistent and easily accessible enrichment activities, when they offer more than just breakfast or lunch, and when they involve children (and parents) in food preparation.Medway Council is looking to commission new and existing holiday providers to develop and build on and enhance the delivery of existing healthy food and enrichment holiday programmes across Medway.",Holiday and Food Activities Summer 2021

The technologies themselves may have existed for some time or be cutting-edge, but their diffusion into industry is at an early stage, with low take-up ahead of wide-scale adoption. Examples include industrial digitalisation technologies such as additive manufacturing, robotics, AI, electrification and advanced materials.Following January's Skills for Jobs White Paper, we launched the first Emerging Skills Project in partnership with the High Value Manufacturing Catapult and the Institutes of Technology. This project uses the Skills Value Chain approach to stimulate the adoption of cutting-edge skills in a given sector. The Skills Value Chain is made up of three core activities, delivered collaboratively in succession:-	Foresighting, an activity that forecasts emerging skills in a sector and identifies the gap in current provision and future need.-	Development of open license training content to meet the gaps identified in foresighting. -	Skills Diffusion, which consists of:o	'Train the trainer' days.o	Provision of no-charge trainee days to upskill employees in the new emerging skills training content.In addition to announcing the first Emerging Skills Project, the White Paper also explored whether this Skills Value Chain approach can be used in other emerging skills areas and to support Government priorities such as net zero. The focus for this second, net-zero project, is electrification. This project will provide some of the skills needed to deliver Point 4 of the Government's ten-point plan for a Green Industrial Revolution - accelerating the shift to zero emission vehicles.This procurement exercise is to put in place a contract to deliver the second two activities of the Skills Value Chain. The first activity, foresighting, will be delivered through a separate agreement. The services required are:1.	Development of short courses to meet emerging skills needs in electrification using the outputs from foresighting conducted in the Summer 2021. 2.	Training and other necessary support of teaching staff in chosen providers to teach the courses developed at (1) through 'train the trainer' training days. 3.	Delivery of courses developed at (1) to learner through the upskilling days for employees in the sector. As the Skills Value Chain requires collaboration between organisations, we would expect bids to demonstration collaborative working.",Emerging Skills Programme in electrification for the Department for Education

Evidence is currently largely based on the impacts on mudflats from opportunistic macroalgae. However, there is concern that this current indicator of water quality is not taking account sufficiently the wider ecosystem effects of elevated nutrients in our estuaries. Water quality sampling can vary greatly throughout the year, assessments of these using these indicators are not always close to where the Zostera beds are present and there is literature that suggests seagrass health can be affected at lower nutrient concentrations than indicated by high densities of macroalgae over littoral sediment. Throughout the Solent and Poole Harbour there have been significant declines in the extent of seagrass and some loss at least has been linked to eutrophication through the smothering of plants by macroalgae. Moreover, wider literature highlights that the health of seagrass can be impacted directly through an increase in indicators of poor health e.g. incidence of Labyrynthula infection and excessive epiphytic growth, with indications that this effect occurs at lower nutrient loadings than that leading to dense macroalgae biomass on mudflats.Despite these effects of elevated nutrients on seagrass being highlighted as a concern in global literature little in the way of studies have been undertaken in the UK. This project proposes a study of the seagrass in estuaries in the Solent and Poole Harbour area over Summer 2021 in order to better understand the relationship between the health of seagrass and elevated nutrients in the Southern estuaries and whether a more suitable indicator can be found that represents how water quality - nutrients is affecting seagrass. With respect to the 'health' of seagrass (and depending on budget) the project may also include an assessment of carbon storage through analysis of sediment core samples for carbon. There is some evidence that in eutrophic waters the capability of seagrass to store carbon within their sediment is impaired (Lima et al, 2020) and their function as a blue carbon habitat diminished.",Assessment of seagrass health in response to water quality in the Solent & Poole Harbour

We are commissioning a system of provision (the Service System) rather than a single service.As part of this DSVA re-commissioning exercise, Leicestershire County Council, invites Tenders for the provision of Domestic and Sexual Violence and Abuse Accommodation Related Support Services.The proposed Contract will be for an initial period from 01 April 2022 to 31 March 2025 with an option to extend, subject to satisfactory performance outcomes and agreement by the Authority, for a further period up to a total of two years (24months) to 31 March 2027, taking the contract term to a maximum of 5 years.The Authority wishes to ensure that procurement opportunities are open to small local enterprises and voluntary and community sector organisations as it appreciates the very important role they play in the local economy.  Tenders from these organisations are particularly welcomed.The Authority has established the procurement process on the basis of funding it is currently.  However, the Authorities does anticipate receiving some additional funding from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG). Contracts have been written with precise but flexible options for variation so that this additional funding can be used to secure additional services through this contract should the Authority so wish.The contract value for this service is £120,000 per annum.  An estimated contract value for the proposed 5-year period if extension options are utilised is £600,000.The Authorities are commissioning a system of provision (the Service System) rather than a single service so this specification (which is for part of the system) should be read in conjunction with the Overarching Model Document which sets out the Service System.A Helpline and Engagement Service will be the main local access point for victims of domestic and sexual violence and abuse (and those supporting them) and as such it will offer a ""front door"" to other support services.  By taking this approach we intend to reduce victims re-telling their experiences multiple times, reduce delay and improve co-ordination and relationships.The Authority is conducting this procurement under the Light Touch Regime for Social and Other Specific Services, as set out in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, (Regulations 74 to 77).",Domestic and Sexual Violence and Abuse Accommodation Related Support Services

The Main Duct is approximately 1 kilometre long, and is sub divided into two equal halves, North & South. The Duct is also a designated confined space. The Main Duct interlocks with approximately 20 No. sub ducts, each sub duct forms a service entry into the associated buildings. The Duct system equates to approximately 2100 metres in total.   The University commissioned a DSEAR risk assessment, and subsequently the Natural Gas Infrastructure is undergoing a replacement/upgrade programme. This Phase 2 project involves the replacement of RAG rated aging gas infrastructure with stainless steel gas pipework and fittings, located within the sub ducts and also underground works required outside of the duct.  The majority of the works is located in a designated confined space, but there is also the need for excavations with the installation of MDPE gas pipe and by pass arrangements and as such the Contractor will have to be fully aware of the restrictions and constraints that this will put upon the project. The project has been designed in a way to ensure downtime and loss of service to existing supplies are minimised, particularly to accommodation blocks which are occupied all year round and this requirement needs to be fully understood by the Contractor.The University is adopting a phased approach ensuring the Spine Duct and sub ducts continue to be compliant with legislation. Further work packages will be developed for future phases.The location of the site is Bailrigg Campus, Lancaster, LA1 4YW.This tender is not lotted. One contractor will be awarded the full package of work.The University will host accompanied site visits on Thursday 20/05/21 and Friday 21/05/21.

The users are mainly from Haslingfield but also come from surrounding villages, some as far as Royston. It is used all year round, on weekends during the summer months there are on average of 20 users a day. There is also a basketball court on site. CURRENT SITUATION Unfortunately, due to its age and construction of its time, the skate park is in need of a complete overhaul. The ramps are mainly constructed out of wood, including the framework and surfaces, overtime these ramps have suffered from wear and tear, from use, resulting in cracks and damage in the wood, allowing moisture to enter thus rotting the structures over time. The parish council have repaired and replaced various parts of each ramp unit but we have now reached a point of non economic viability, any money spent now on repairs would not last long and the money would be better spent on investing in new ramps and equipment. The basket ball court is also in need up of updating, the surface is covered in moss and algae which when wet can be very slippery and dangerous. The hoops and nets are broken and rusty. PLANWe have spoken to various contractors and obtained prices for like for like ramps, these are sufficient and would be a marked improvement, but what is clear from demand and perhaps a more long term solution would be to invest in a brand new concrete skatepark. FINANCINGWe are in the process of applying for an Amey grant.

This would allow research, proof of concept and demonstrate its feasibility and small volume prototype build.As part of the electronics package assembly research and development methodology we require a machine that can produce customised prototype metal parts using additive manufacturing technology. This will allow the CSA Catapult to support the Driving the Electric Revolution - Industrialisation Centres (DERIC) programme that is currently active within the UK in developing novel technology for power electronic devices and other types of semiconductor devices. The intention is that the additive manufacturing of bespoke metal components will closely support the requirements of development programmes and further the development of electronic and semiconductor device packaging with novel solutions not currently possible using traditional manufacturing techniques. The equipment will also compliment the hybridisation programmes for packaging that are currently in progress at the CSA Catapult. The equipment shall be flexible and be able to process several metals compatible with the advanced packaging of electronic devices. These include copper, nickel alloys, and stainless steels. Other materials may be of interest as well due the nature of any developments.The manufacturer/authorised vendor shall install the system at CSA Catapults Innovation Centre, which will be equipped with access to all power and services for full installation and operation and be used to support contract research and development or commercial opportunities within the UK. The manufacturer/authorised vendor is also responsible for providing necessary training, warranty and service/maintenance supportSystem OutlineThe system architecture is expected to be a standalone machine and is expected to have additional post processing equipment to support the component build. This will include equipment for cleaning, curing and sintering of the parts to produce this final component. It may also include equipment to handle, store and sort the raw material.The system should have capability to be used for both prototype device and low volume production quantities. The system shall be easy to configure and change for the user to allow different processes.A system solution is required that is flexible and upgradeable in the future. Additional module options can then be purchased based on changing industry trends or specific requirements from customers or partners for technology development. The system should also include user software, installation and training.The estimated value of the contract is £450,000 to £550,000 including all options and extensions. The system will be ordered in June and installed in October 2021.",Metal 3D Printer

IAPT services remain a key focus of the LTP in delivering the improved outcomes aspired to by linking mental health and physical health. The LTP sets out a commitment to expanding IAPT services with a view to increasing access to psychological therapies for an additional 390,000 people with common mental health problems which means that by 2023/24 1.9 million people nationally each year will access treatment via IAPT services.As IAPT services expand there has been a need identified to increase access for people who are Deaf and use BSL.

Therefore, central funding has been identified to pilot a national BSL IAPT offer.Deaf people are currently believed to be vastly underrepresented in IAPT services. They face a number of barriers including misdiagnosis and availability of appropriate communication aids.

The Framework will serve as the primary route to procure building maintenance projects for Building Services within the Council, with works generally being undertaken to the Councils portfolio of nearly 15,000 social housing properties and 900 corporate assets.

The framework agreement will be established via evaluation of tenders submitted for Phase 1 works on Dunsmore Close, flats 26-44, which comprises of a repair and improvement scheme to a Local Authority block of flats. Upon completion of Phase 1, the Council reserve the right to directly award a further two phases of works for additional blocks of flats in Dunsmore Close to the successful tenderer. The estimated value for the works are -       o Phase 1 - Flats 26-44 - ?350K      o Phase 2 - Flats 46-102 - ?800K       o Phase 3 - Flats 2-24 - ?450K            The project will be let on an individual basis to the tendering contractor who achieves the highest score following assessment of submitted bids under a JCT Intermediate Contract 2016.

Functional health assessment providers support the payment of welfare benefits to some of the most vulnerable in our society. Functional health assessments currently assess eligibility for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), Universal Credit (UC) and Personal Independence Payment (PIP); focusing on needs arising from a condition rather than the condition itself. These assessments are only one part of the evidence that the DWP Decision Maker will consider and decisions on assessment criteria and benefit entitlement will rest with the DWP Decision Maker alone on behalf of the Secretary of State. PIP is a DWP benefit intended to compensate for some of the extra costs of those who have long term ill-health or disabilities. It is available to people whether they are in work, training, education or not, it is tax-free and is not means tested. PIP also acts as a gateway to other benefits and support in both DWP administered benefits. Most notably, additional premia in ESA or Carer's Allowance and also wider services, including the Motability scheme and Local Authority services, such as the Blue Badge Scheme. Approximately 900,000 assessments are carried out annually under the current PIP contract (data from 2017/18).Work Capability Assessments (WCA) currently assess eligibility for ESA and UC. A smaller number of other assessments assess eligibility to a range of benefits delivered by DWP and other Government Departments. Approximately 1 million WCA and a minimum of 100,000 other assessments are carried out annually under the current Health Disability Assessment Services (HDAS) contract (data from 2017/18).HDAS and PIP assessment services are currently delivered through separate contracts by separate suppliers. FAS will deliver both assessment services through one contract with a single supplier, in each geographical Lot. DWP will procure a Functional Assessment Service across England and Wales.

NHSE/I are in the very early stages of engagement and Expressions of Interest (EOIs) received will be used to help NHSE/I determine their recommissioning strategy for these services. NHSE/I is likely to commission a prime provider model for prison healthcare services in order to support integrated, patient centred care across the full range of service specialties required to manage the complex healthcare needs of those in the prison settings. NHSE/I will hold a long-term contract (likely to be 7 years) with the prime provider, who in turn can directly provide care and/or subcontract care to other specialist providers. The prime provider will also be responsible for ensuring that all healthcare services operating within the prison work in an integrated way, delivering seamless care pathways.The final range of in-scope services is yet to be determined, but is likely to include at a minimum, most or all of the following: primary health care, pharmacy, optometry, dental, substance misuse services and mental health provision. Contracts are currently expected to commence on 1st October 2022 and end on 30th September 2029. Whilst we may wish to undertake further engagement with the market over the coming months, the formal stages of the procurement process are expected to commence in Summer 2021. Please note that dates may be subject to change.There are 11 establishments across the South West and future provision is likely to be contracted via prime provider contracts for each of the following (anticipated) four lots:1.

TTF is currently managed by one supplier. The service requirements include, but not limited to administration of funding, general administration, evaluation, market insight, marketing, and end to end programme management. Programme Aims  Given the wider economic importance of FE in raising skills levels and providing a passport to opportunity for young people and adults - particularly through the successful delivery of T Levels and apprenticeships - we need sufficient numbers of highly skilled teachers in place to deliver high quality, work relevant skills training. But there is also a very real need for those teachers to possess industry expertise and excellent teaching skills. This is paramount for delivering first-rate FE teaching.   The aim of TTF is to increase the number of highly skilled teachers in place to deliver high quality, work relevant skills training by supporting FE providers to recruit and retain new teachers. Current Provision  The Education and Training Foundation (ETF) have delivered this programme through three pilot rounds, from 2018/19 to 2021/22 and a fourth round has just been announced. For further information, please see the ETF website. https://www.et-foundation.co.uk/supporting/support-teacher-recruitment/taking-teaching-further/Planned TTF Growth  Given the current shortage of FE teachers, we are developing proposals to continue to deliver the initiative. Rounds 1 and 2 offered places for 150 teachers, and round 3 made 550 places available. Round 4 will make a further 550 places available to the sector. The size and scope of this initiative in the future is expanding in response to participant feedback but the extent of these changes is yet to be confirmed. However, based on current information, we anticipate it could be around 1,000 places in the first year, rising to 4,000 in the third year.

These local 'call-offs' will be matched to the bespoke needs of local commissioners. To ensure the PDPS can be managed efficiently while also being sensitive to local commissioner (and provider) needs it will be broken down in to Lots Lot 1 - Substantive APMS Contracts Lot 2 - GP Caretaker Contracts The PDPS will be further broken down into geographical sub-Lots (7 sub-Lots in line with the 7 NHSEI regional areas). GP Providers can apply to be an approved APMS and/or caretaker provider in one or more of the stated Lots and Sub-Lots. Application on to the approved provider list does not commit providers to providing APMS services, nor does it guarantee a provider will be awarded a contract through the PDPS, but it does mean providers will be able to bid when local needs arise. Applications to join the PDPS will be managed in consecutive ""Rounds"". These Rounds have specific start and end dates by which applications must be submitted. If a provider misses the deadline to submit an application for a particular Round, they can submit their application for evaluation as part of the next Round. Round 10 Start : 28.09.2020  End: 23.10.2020 Round 11 Start : 26.10.2020  End: 20.11.2020 Round 12 Start : 23.11.2020  End: 18.12.2020 Please refer to the online document set available at the EU Supply e-tendering portal (link above) for further details. The Services in the scope of this procurement fall within Schedule 3 to the Public Contracts Regulations 2015(""the Regulations"") which are not subject to the full regime of the Regulations, but is instead governed by the ""Light Touch Regime"" (LTR) contained within Chapter 3, Section 7 of the Regulations (Regulations 74 to 77).

Make Happen is the working name of the current National Collaborative Outreach Programme partnership for Essex, although it is also known as the Essex Collaborative Outreach Network (ECON).        Currently, Make Happen uses a model where schools and those including sixth forms work collaboratively with their Collaborative Outreach Officer to design a programme of activity which suits their needs and encourages students to progress to higher education.  Further Education (FE) Institutions follow a Make Happen led programme, where students are exposed to a variety of workshops linked to their future successes, including CV and Personal Statement Writing, applications to HE and what to expect on an open day.       As it stands, the National Collaborative Outreach Programme (NCOP) brings together 29 partnerships of universities, colleges and other local partners to deliver outreach programmes to young people in years 9 to 13. Their work is focused on local areas where higher education participation is lower than might be expected given the GCSE results of the young people who live there.      The current programme started in January 2017 and aims to:      •	reduce the gap in higher education participation between the most and least represented groups      •	support young people to make well-informed decisions about their future education      •	support effective and impactful local collaboration by higher education providers working together with schools, colleges, employers and other partners      •	contribute to a stronger evidence base around 'what works' in higher education outreach and strengthen evaluation practice in the sector.

The DPS is for the procurement of social and other services referred to in Regulation 74 of the Public Contracts Regulations (2015) and as such, the intention is to use a light touch regime, rather than the full regime described in Regulation 34 (Dynamic Purchasing System). This national DPS is intended to replace the current DPS for Work Focused Activities in DWP Central England Group, also known as the Proof of Concept (PoC). Operating a DPS offers a number of commercial and operational advantages for both the buyer and for the potential Suppliers, compared to traditional contracting methods.  The DPS will be a more effective and responsive tool, with the potential to create administrative savings and allow the buyer to respond to individual requirements more swiftly.  It will simplify and reduce the time and cost involved for those Suppliers on the DPS in bringing their services to market, for example by reducing the duplication of effort created by participation in multiple, separate procurement competitions.  Consequently it is anticipated that the DPS will, over time, be extended to procure other categories of service spend.This National DPS is for the sole use of the DWP.The anticipated period of the DPS will run from the date of signing of the earliest DPS Agreement (likely to be 25 July 2016), for four years.   Estimated funding for Work Focused Activities for 2016-2017, excluding VAT, will be up to £35m. Thereafter funding for DPS procurement will be annually agreed (amounts to be confirmed), and may include monies from other funding streams.The Invitation to Tender Pack is available on Bravosolution.
